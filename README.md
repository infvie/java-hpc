A couple very basic multi-threaded scripts in Java I wrote for practice. These examples are based on the examples from this excellent [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-multithreading-concurrency-performance-optimization/). I would highly recommend it. 

* `create` a simple script showing the ways threads are initialized
* `vault` one thread trys to stop another thread from hacking a vault
* `simpleMath` speeding up a large computation using threads
* `imageProcessing` a multithreading script to turn a color scale image to a grayscale image
