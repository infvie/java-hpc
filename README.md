A couple very basic multi-threaded scripts in Java I wrote for practice.

* `create` a simple script showing the ways threads are initialized
* `vault` one thread trys to stop another thread from hacking a vault
* `simpleMath` speeding up a large computation using threads
* `imageProcessing` a multithreading script to turn a color scale image to a grayscale image
